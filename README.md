This repository contains two R scripts that address different data visualization and analysis problems. The first problem focuses on analyzing the distribution of medals in the 2021 Olympics using the `Olympics2021Medals.csv` dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkayalan/2021-olympics-medals-in-tokyo ). Key tasks include calculating total medal counts by country, visualizing medal distribution (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and comparing top-performing countries.

The second problem uses a Formula 1 dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020), to analyze race data. The analysis explores driver performance, lap times, and race outcomes over different seasons. Key insights include visualizing race results and performance trends across multiple races and tracks.

Both scripts provide clear visualizations to help explore and understand the data in a meaningful way.
